# PyCrust 🥧 [WIP] 🚧

_Pie-crust / Py(c)Rust_

PyCrust is a command-line tool that transpiles Python code to Rust code, replacing Python libraries with equivalent Rust libraries wherever possible. It uses the OpenAI ChatGPT API to perform the transpilation.

## Usage 🚀

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/JediRhymeTrix/pycrust.git`
3. `cd pycrust`
4. Create a `.env` file with your ChatGPT API key: `echo "API_KEY=<your-api-key>" > .env`
5. Give the runner shell script the appropriate permission to run: `chmod +x scripts/pycrust.sh`
6. Run the Docker container and transpile your code using the command `./pycrust.sh /path/to/input.py` to transpile the Python code to Rust code. The output will be saved in a file with the same name as the input file, but with the `.rs` extension.

## Dependencies 📦

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- OpenAI ChatGPT API key

## Notes 📝

- This tool is still in development and may not work with all Python code.
- The Rust code generated by PyCrust may require additional work to compile and run.
- If a Rust equivalent library for a Python library does not exist, PyCrust will generate a list of missing dependencies.
